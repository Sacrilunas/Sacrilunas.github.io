Laura Sacristan-Lagunas, born in February 8th 2002, is a Spanish native who moved to the United States with her family in 2012. She returns home most summers and some winter breaks to visit her extended family. She is fluent in both Spanish and English and is studying French both in school and independently.  In her spare time she likes to read, and play sports, but mostly enjoys building things. In the summer of 2017 she build a treehouse  with her father. She also helps fix things around the house such as the garage door.

At schools she likes to challenge herself, taking the hardest classes available to her and striving to do her best. Meanwhile she runs track and plays volleyball.
